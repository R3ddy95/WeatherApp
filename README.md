# Weather App ⛅  
WeatherApp is a web application that allows users to view weather forecasts for a specific city. The app uses React, Material-UI, and Redux for state management.


## How it works
Users can input the city name, retrieve real-time weather data, and see an animated icon representing the weather conditions, and other informations about the city weather..
